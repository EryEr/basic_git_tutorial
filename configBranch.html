<h1> Creating another branch to have a look at solving a conflict between the branches</h1>



<p> While working in a feature branch, some colleagues may merge another change into the same place we are currently working.</p>
<p> Different information, data or entry in the same place cause a conflict that must be solved by selecting the actual one.</p>

<p> after creating a new branch in first  data send to the cloud insteadof directly using <code>git push</code> command</p>
<p> we need to use this <code>git push --set-upstream origin conflictBranch</code> command</p>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<p> Is there a conflict in here?.</p>

<p> Someone made some corrections for these typo and spelling-grammar mistakes.</p>
<p> To be able to create this conflict we directly made these correction in GitHub UI site for a quick solution.</p>

<p> When we try to merge the main branch to our conflictBranch we faced with this conflict .</p>

<p> You can find the conflict file from directory tree with its different colour.Head represent the part in current branch and main section shows the different part in main branch</p>

<p> When we decide to the right choice then we need to commit this selection then we can merge, and then we can push all these changes into the cloud .</p>

<p> Is there a conflict in here?.</p>
<p> Now, there is no conflict. It is sorted.</p>
