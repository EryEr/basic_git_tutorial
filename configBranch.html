<h1> Creating another branch to have a look at solving a conflict between the branches</h1>



<p> While working in a feature branch, some colleagues may merge another change into the same place we are currently working.</p>
<p> Different information, data or entry in the same place face a conflict that must be solved by selecting the actual one.</p>

<p> Is there a conflict in here?.</p>
