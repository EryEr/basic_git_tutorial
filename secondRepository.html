<p> After adding all the necessary update and changes in this branch we need to create a MR (Merge request, PS:in some company they may call as PR for pull request words) </p>

<p> Your colleagues who appointed as a reviewer may put some commands or they may mention issues for your updates like below</p>

<p> After changes for the improvement of these issues needs to push all changes into the branch again and asking review again. </p>


<p> After colleagues acceptance, merge button turn to green. Then you can merge all the changes from secondBranch to the master branch</p>
